# belly-button-challenge

## Background
#### In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

#### For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

The D3 library will be used to read in ```samples.json``` from the following URL:

Project file can be found in the ```static``` folder, titled ```app.js```.
